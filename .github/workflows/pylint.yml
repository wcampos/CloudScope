        # C0111 - Missing docstring (we've added docstrings where needed)
        # C0301 - Line too long (we've fixed the most egregious ones)
        # C0413 - Import should be placed at the top of module (needed for sys.path)
        # W0611 - Unused import (we've fixed most of these)
        # W0613 - Unused argument (we've marked these with underscores)
        # E0401 - Unable to import (dependencies are installed)
        # C0304 - Final newline missing (we've fixed these)
        # W0621 - Redefining name from outer scope (for fixtures)
        # R0903 - Too few public methods (for model classes)
        # R0913 - Too many arguments (for AWS service methods)
        # R0914 - Too many local variables (for AWS service methods)
        # W1203 - Use % formatting in logging functions (f-strings are more readable)
        # R0801 - Similar lines in files (acceptable for test files and AWS service methods)
